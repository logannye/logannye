-  Hi, I’m @logannye
 I'm a physician at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science. Prior to CMU, I was an AI researcher at Harvard Medical School, where I built deep learning models for diagnostic medical imaging and histopathology.

I'm interested in exploring ways to use artificial intelligence and computational technologies to advance human heatlh.
