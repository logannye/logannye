-  Hi, I’m @logannye
 I'm a physician and computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science. Before CMU I was an AI researcher at Harvard Medical School, where I built deep learning models for diagnostic medical imaging and histopathology.

I'm interested in using computational paradigms to solve disease.
